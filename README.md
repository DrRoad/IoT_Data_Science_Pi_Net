# IoT_Data_Science_Pi_Net

The folders in this directory provide the language-specific version of the code to accompany my Instructables.com tutorial on building an IoT Data Science data visualization network of Pi-based smart screens.

You do not need all of these, just the one for your language.

At the time of writing only R and Python are available for the launch of the tutorial. Additional language support may be available and contributions are highly encouraged!
